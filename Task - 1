-- Step 1: Create Database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS StudentManagement;
USE StudentManagement;

-- Step 2: Create Students Table
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Gender ENUM('M', 'F'),
    Age INT,
    Grade VARCHAR(10),
    MathScore INT,
    ScienceScore INT,
    EnglishScore INT
);

-- Step 3: Insert Sample Data
INSERT INTO Students (Name, Gender, Age, Grade, MathScore, ScienceScore, EnglishScore)
VALUES 
('Alice', 'F', 15, 'A', 95, 88, 92),
('Bob', 'M', 16, 'B', 78, 80, 75),
('Charlie', 'M', 17, 'A', 88, 90, 85),
('David', 'M', 15, 'C', 60, 55, 70),
('Emma', 'F', 16, 'B', 75, 78, 80),
('Frank', 'M', 17, 'A', 90, 95, 88),
('Grace', 'F', 15, 'A', 85, 80, 82),
('Henry', 'M', 16, 'C', 55, 65, 60),
('Isabel', 'F', 17, 'B', 72, 70, 74),
('Jack', 'M', 15, 'A', 82, 85, 90);

-- Step 4: Display All Students
SELECT * FROM Students;

-- Step 5: Calculate Average Scores for Each Subject
SELECT 
    AVG(MathScore) AS Avg_Math_Score, 
    AVG(ScienceScore) AS Avg_Science_Score, 
    AVG(EnglishScore) AS Avg_English_Score
FROM Students;

-- Step 6: Find the Student with the Highest Total Score
SELECT Name, (MathScore + ScienceScore + EnglishScore) AS TotalScore
FROM Students
ORDER BY TotalScore DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Step 7: Count the Number of Students in Each Grade
SELECT Grade, COUNT(*) AS Student_Count
FROM Students
GROUP BY Grade;

-- Step 8: Find the Average Score for Male and Female Students
SELECT Gender, 
       AVG(MathScore) AS Avg_Math, 
       AVG(ScienceScore) AS Avg_Science, 
       AVG(EnglishScore) AS Avg_English
FROM Students
GROUP BY Gender;

-- Step 9: Identify Students Whose Math Score is Above 80
SELECT * FROM Students
WHERE MathScore > 80;

-- Step 10: Update the Grade of a Student with a Specific Student ID
UPDATE Students
SET Grade = 'A+'
WHERE StudentID = 5;  -- Change StudentID as needed
